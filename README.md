##Description
I never play golf in my life... but, if I start it, I definitely use this app. 
Because, it can store the stroke number all about the 18 holes, almost every cases. 
No problem, if you push the home button, when you playing golf. Or you can calmy closing the app. 
Or turn off your phone.. The scores will always stay with you! (Except, if you destroy your device or delete the app...)  

######What I learned now :tada:
* Using more layouts.
* Creating and managing ListView.
* Basic introspection in Adapters and LayoutInflater.
* Take care about an activity lifecycle.
* Storing in SharedPreferences.
* Creating own menu *(Right, if you tuch the menu button, finally something will happens :wink:)*

**Known issue:** *The menu dosn't shown on the action bar... Maybe because of the theme.. I don't know, yet.*
